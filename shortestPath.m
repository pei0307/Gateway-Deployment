% ShortestPath_V1() gets a binary image and determines the shortest path between two
% points on the image using distance transform. 
% Path is defined as the WHITE pixels between the two points!
% 
% function [path] = ShortestPath_V1(image)
% 
% path      : Binary image. showing the shortest path wit 1s
% I         : Binary image, where shortest path to be found. (Path = WHITE pixel)
% varargin  : String, 'demo' shows the path
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

function [path] = shortestPath(I,varargin)

if numel(I(1,1,:)) == 3
    I = rgb2gray(I); % converst to grayscale in case of an RGB image
end    

% ID = imdilate(I < (max(max(I))./2), ones(7,7)); % complementing the image and then dilating it
ID = (I < (max(max(I))./2));
